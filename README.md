# Retrieval Augmented Generation using Langchain, Chainlit and ChromaDB

This project is a virtual gardening advisor built using a chat interface. The system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the user experience by offering personalized plant recommendations.

## Program Architecture

A database was created using Scrapy to extract data from the e-katalogroslin website. The data was subsequently translated into English and embedded into ChromaDB.

The program's primary function is to collect detailed information from the user regarding their needs in order to recommend a plant from the database that best matches their expectations. Each plant in the database is categorized by type (e.g., deciduous, coniferous, perennial, etc.), allowing for the implementation of a filter based on this parameter.

Throughout the conversation, the program generates a list of plant characteristics mentioned by the user. This list is then utilized to search the database for plants that match the user's criteria. The top 5 plants from the database are selected as context for the language model (LLM), which then recommends 2 of these plants to the user. Additionally, images of the suggested plants are displayed to enhance the user experience.

## Future Work

Plans include experimenting with various prompting techniques, such as multi-query approaches. Additionally, a filter will be implemented to verify that the response generated by the LLM aligns with the documents in the database.
